## 🧩 Game Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a simple grid-based game played between two players. One uses **X**, the other **O**. Players take turns marking empty squares, and the first to align three of their marks in a row — **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally** — wins!

If all squares are filled and no one wins, it’s a **draw**.
